To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the base directory of your project. This directory should contain the source files along with a Makefile that has the 'all' target (it's been provided in the starter code) 
2. From that directory, execute the runtests executable in this directory
  Like:  ~cs537-1/tests/P6/runtests

The output from runtests will indicate which tests you have passed and which you failed (if any)
