resetExample/fP -k -W [options/fP] argument
.SH Description
This is a fake example program.  The command line switches, options, and
arguments don't actually exist since this is just an example.

This text is in a new paragraph.  Blank lines should also be output.
So this paragraph/fP should have a blank line before it.
You should see bold/fP, italic/fP, and underline/fP and
these can be combined/fP.  You can also output characters.

Typical man pages will have a NAME section, a SYNOPSIS section,
and a DESCRIPTION section (at least).  The NAME and DESCRIPTION
sections are important for the apropos program.
