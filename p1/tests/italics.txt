So this paragraph should have a blank line before it.
You should see bold, /fIitalic/fP, and underline and
these can be /fIcombined/fP.  You can also output __ characters.

Typical man pages will have a NAME section, a SYNOPSIS section,
and a DESCRIPTION section (at least).  The NAME and DESCRIPTION
sections are important for the apropos program.
